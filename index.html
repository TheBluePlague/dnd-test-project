            <h2>Summary of Quest of Amoria</h2>
                <p> The campaign started out in the small village of Ravenwood with 
                a red haired girl walking into the adventurers guild in search 
                for a job. She walked in and met another lone adventurer and 
                they decided to set out together with the goal of surviving 
                some simple adventures to grow stronger and more experienced.
                They soon met two more adventurers and set out on an adventure 
                to fight a bandit camp to the south together. They succeeded and 
                continued by traveling from Ravenwood to the trade town of Dimmouth 
                where they cleared an infested mine of eldritch horrors guarding a 
                forgotten Grimoar of magic. They learned that these grimoars were 
                created by an evil mage and are now scattered accross the world with 
                a cult trying to gather up all of them to unleash the magical horrors 
                hidden inside once more. They got rewarded for their bravery and continued 
                their travels finding a second book in the capital city of tregaron before 
                doing a few smaller quest but as important if not more to make a name for 
                themselves and gear up for the upcoming battles against the cult and a new 
                threat which came from the east and flew in breathing fire and destruction 
                where ever it went. So far they have collected 2 grimoars with 2 more to go 
                before they have them all and they have made a lot of friends in their travels 
                but also enemies with dragons and cultists alike trying to hunt them down</p>
